This is a Learning Management System LMS I developed alongside my duo partner Andy Duong at the University of Utah for CS 5530. The purpose of this assignment was to prove, as a final project, that I understood and could implement a database application. I developed the SQL database which serves as the backend for this LMS. I also wrote the C# code responsible for reads and writes to the database. My professor provided front-end web code for formatting the website application.
