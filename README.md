This is a Learning Management System LMS I developed alongside my duo partner Andy Duong at the University of Utah for CS 5530. The purpose of this assignment was to prove as a final project that I understood and could implement a database application. I developed the SQL database which serves as the backend for this LMS. And I wrote the C# code responsible for read and writes with the database. Code for formatting the website application was provided by my professor.
